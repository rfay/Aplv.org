translatableregions adds the ability for the user to machine-translate
specific regions which you specify as CSS selectors.

Installation
------------

Copy the translatableregions folder to your sites/all/modules directory,
then enable it at Administer > Modules.

Configure the Google API key and the CSS selectors for the regions that you want
to work with at Administer > Configuration > Regional > Translatable Regions.

Information about the (paid) Google Translate API v2 is at
https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/pricing

If you want the user to be able to control whether the translate button
is shown, enable the associated block that allows it to be turned on or
off.
