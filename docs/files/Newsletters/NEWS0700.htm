<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After an 18 month hiatus, the APLV technical school is starting up
again with six new students. One of our goals this round was to include women in the
training and we are happy to report that our new class consists of three women and three
men. Although Nicaragua has made some advances in terms of gender issues, it is still
uncommon to find women in technical careers. We received nearly 30 applications for
admission to the program without an enormous amount of advertising- an indication that
people find the school valuable.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mathieu Le Corre will be the main instructor. Mathieu joined the APLV
team last November and has been providing technical support in Rio Blanco. He has
experience with a French NGO (GRET) working in Mauritania and speaks fluent French,
Spanish and English. We are excited to have him aboard. He writes: </p>

  <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Working on a smaller scale is a great experience for me as it has
  allowed me to see practical detail I was unaware of- both on the pure engineering side and
  on the organisational side . On a personal level this type of work is fulfilling as there
  is a sense of being part of a down-to-earth construction effort. Apart from that there is
  the thundering of rain on our tin roof, a glow worm scrambling along my mosquito net, the
  Musun mountain in the mist and the frog that lives under our sink.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three Projects Underway</p>
</b></i></font><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Construction is taking place in three APLV water projects: Santa Rita,
La Isla, and Quatro Esquinas. Santa Rita, population 1500, is the largest project APLV has
ever taken on. The project management issues in a large community are significant, but the
community has made significant progress. La Isla and Quatro Esquinas are more typical
projects, with about 25-30 families each. We have received a substantial private donation
to sponsor the work in La Isla, which involves bringing water from high on the Musun
mountain slope down to a deep valley and then back up the other side to the village.
Quatro Esquinas is a more remote town and passage by truck is impossible now that the
rains have started. Much of the material will be brought in by mules and horses.</p>

<p>Health and Nutrition Program Update</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have continued working on preventive health. We are satisfied
because we have seen the fruit of the work we have done: statistically we have noted a
fall in the number of diarrhoeas and in the past two years there have been no deaths of
cholera in the communities we work in. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have observed hygiene habit changes in the villagers for instance:
there are more clean patios and covered water containers now than there were. Obviously
the change hasn&#146;t touched 100 % of the families, we know it is a long winded process.
That is why a great deal of our effort is concentrated on children, if we can change their
habits the results will be much better in the future. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic methodology we use both with children and adults is to bring
about participation. To do this we mix singing, stories, drama as well as presentations,
this makes understanding the material we want to share easier. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here&#146;s one of the songs we use to motivate children and adults
during our sessions (it is presented here both in Spanish and in English):</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First Impressions of APLV</p>
</b></font></i><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RJ Bunnel and Lee Addams are two Stanford students who recently took a
trip down to Nicaragua to see APLV&#146;s operation first-hand. Here is what RJ had to
say:</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My friend Lee Addams and I have spent a considerable amount of time
searching for opportunities to get involved in water development projects. That is why we
are so excited to have come across Agua Para la Vida. Lee is a hydrogeology graduate
student and I am a recent graduate with a BS degree in water resource engineering. Both of
us think water is some pretty interesting and indispensable stuff. Clean water is vitally
important to a healthy life and we both hope to employ our education in bringing this most
precious of resources to the people who need it most. A.P.L.V. is doing just this in a
novel and effective way. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recently had the opportunity to observe some of A.P.L.V.'s
operations in the Rio Blanco area of central Nicaragua. The trip was quite an adventure
and also a great chance for us to see firsthand how A.P.L.V. is working to better the
lives of the people in rural Nicaragua. The following are a few thoughts on two noteworthy
aspects of the A.P.L.V. program that we observed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing that we discovered about the Agua Para la Vida operation in
Nicaragua is that it is working to make itself unnecessary by giving communities the
knowledge and leadership they need to help themselves. Through a small technical school in
Rio Blanco, A.P.L.V. trains members of local communities to design and lead the
construction of the various water systems that they fund. The group also trains community
organizers to aid in gathering the people of a village together to complete the
construction of their own water system. We were able to meet and observe the very capable
and dedicated local leadership of such a project in a remote town called Santa Rita,
Nicaragua's version of the Wild West. Instead of bringing in outside labor to complete the
project, A.P.L.V. is providing the community with the material and skilled leadership that
they need to build their very own water capture and distribution system. This emphasis on
grassroots organization and self-empowerment serves to give the community a sense of
unity, pride, and accomplishment in building their own safe water supply. We noticed a
great camaraderie at the Santa Rita project that probably wouldn't have existed in a group
that wasn't locally organized and led. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also observed that Agua Para la Vida employs a unique 'big picture'
approach that is crucial to ensuring that their water projects make the greatest possible
contributions to the overall health of the communities they serve. The group not only
captures the output of local springs to feed the distribution systems, but also organizes
the community to buy and protect as much of the watershed as possible so that the springs
will stay clean and viable for years to come. Reforestation of the community owned
watersheds is also an important element in this effort. Planting trees makes sure that the
spring's output is sufficient during the long dry season, and has added environmental
benefits in a zone who's tropical forests have suffered almost total devastation at the
hand of subsistence agriculture and grazing. We observed several forested and protected
watersheds or 'cuencas' that were a stark contrast to the barren and sporadically charred
hillsides that surrounded them for miles in every direction. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.P.L.V. also has two wonderful community health educators, Liliam and
Gregoria, who spend ours travelling by bus and by foot to make sure that every person that
will be served by the new water systems has at least rudimentary knowledge of personal
hygiene. Additionally, latrines are required for all the households that are to be
connected to the new water distribution systems. A.P.L.V. is very aware of the fact that
clean water doesn't do any good if it is contaminated at the point of consumption. The
public health and health education program is expanding and is a wonderful and necessary
compliment to the engineering work being done by A.P.L.V. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lee and I left Nicaragua with an increased consciousness of the
enormous amount of work to be done in the developing world if the people there are to
raise their standard of living in a sustainable manner. We also left encouraged that there
are groups like A.P.L.V. that are addressing the most pressing needs of the underserved
people in Nicaragua in a very direct and community empowering way. We hope to remain
involved with A.P.L.V. and do all we can to increase its capacity to touch lives and
improve public health in the developing world. We hope that you will too.</i> </p>
