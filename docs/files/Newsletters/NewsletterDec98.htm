<p>Hurricane Mitch</p>
</i></b>

<p>On October 27, Hurricane Mitch struck Central America, causing serious devastation and
loss of life. The toll in Nicaragua is over 2,500 people dead, 1000 people missing, and an
estimated 900,000 people homeless or otherwise severely affected by the disaster. Basic
infrastructure including roads, bridges, electric and telephone lines were destroyed or
damaged throughout the country. Agriculture, which accounts for over half of the
country&#146;s economic output, took a huge hit. Initial estimates of damage are in the
$1.5 billion range.</p>

<p>Water systems were obviously severely impacted. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Health's
early assessment that the most urgent short-term needs are for food and shelter has been
revised to include clean water and control of communicable diseases. In many areas, water
systems have become extremely contaminated and water-borne diseases such as cholera and
leptospirosis are starting to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Initial reports from <i><b>APLV</b></i> communities in the Rio Blanco region indicate
that the damage to our drinking water systems was minor. This is due to the fact that Rio
Blanco was not hit has hard by the storm as some other regions and also because our
gravity flow spring systems are less susceptible to damage and contamination from flooding
than wells. </p>

<p>A number of <i><b>APLV</b></i> donors contacted us with concern and support. We have
collected several thousand dollars which we have wired to groups we are familiar with
doing excellent relief work. Of course, the recovery work will be ongoing. It will be
decades before the country recovers from this disaster. We are hoping that efforts to
convince lender nations to forgive the foreign debts of the affected countries will be
successful. That would be a huge boost to these people who were in such a difficult
position even before the hurricane.</p>

<p>Gilles and Charlie will be going to Nicaragua in mid January, partly to assess the
situation with our program and partly to attend the ceremony for first graduates of our
school! We will be hiring two of them to work with us and we hope the others will find
water-related work in the region. There is even more to do now after the devastation of <i>Mitch.</p>
</i>

<p>As always, we appreciate your continued support. We will report back in a few months
after our trip.</p>

<p>Peace and Good Health,</p>
