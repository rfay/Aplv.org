<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January, our first class of students graduated from ETAP, APLV's
technical school in Rio Blanco, Nicaragua. The graduation ceremony marked their completion
of a three-year course in gravity-fed drinking water systems and rural sanitation that
included classroom work and substantial field training. It was a joyous and well-attended
event with good food, lots of singing (most notably by Technical Director Juan Carlos
Aráuz) and some impressive dancing, even by some of our most reserved campesino staff!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the five graduates, three (Renaldo Díaz, Jaime Rodríguez, and
Esteban Cantillano) have been given positions with Agua Para La Vida in Rio Blanco where
they have assumed responsibilities for project study, design and construction. One of the
other graduates, Juan Romero Alonso, found work at the local bank, demonstrating a demand
for skills developed in our students that are useful in a broader context than water
projects. The fifth graduate, Oreste Jarquín, was forced to leave the region after the
brutal assassination of his brother in an incident reported in our May 1998 newsletter.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We plan to enroll a second class of students in the near future, but
not before evaluating the employment opportunities of the graduates. We are considering
bringing students from another region to Rio Blanco to train and then return home to work
on water development. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hurricane Mitch Update</p>
</b></i></font><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we reported in our last newsletter, Nicaragua was hit hard by
Hurricane Mitch in November 1998. The damage was all the more devastating because it
occurred in a country without the financial resources to respond- Nicaragua is the second
poorest nation in the Americas (Haiti is the poorest). Near the site of our very first
project in San Dionisio the Rio Grande de Matagalpa, normally a small river as it passes
through town, rose 26 meters (85 feet) and carried whole sections of reinforced concrete
road bridges several hundred meters downstream. The losses were huge and included fertile
land, crops, houses, bridges and power and communication lines. At a national level the
hurricane affected numerous water systems, causing a setback in the construction of new
projects as the National Rural Water Directive (DAR) and international aid organizations
have had to concentrate their efforts on existing system reconstruction and
rehabilitation. The impact of the hurricane on existing systems shows the importance of
building local technical capacity to respond to such situations.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only APLV project which was seriously affected was Cerro Grande
(completed in 1991). This project is located on steep slopes near the small town of San
Ramon. We received a $5,000 donation from CUSO (Canadian University Services Overseas) to
partially fund the reconstruction/rehabilitation of this system. We will be rebuilding the
system this year and are using the occasion to increase the water supply (which had fallen
over the years) by harnessing an additional spring. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two New Projects Underway</p>
</b></i></font><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An event such as Mitch temporarily opens donors&#146; purses to repair
the damage, but for those villages which never had a drinking water system it is harder to
find funding. Agua Para La Vida's two other main undertakings this year deal with such
communities: Wilikon, a community of 414 with barely enough relief to allow a gravity
system; and Santa Rita, 100 km east of Rio Blanco in the township of Siuna. Santa Rita is
the largest project we have undertaken to date, with a current population of 1600 that is
expected to double rapidly. Due to the large size of the project and correspondingly large
budget, we plan to carry out this project in stages. </p>

<p>Community Health Survey</p>
</b></i></font><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gregoria and Lilliam, our health and hygiene educators, have completed
a first cycle of surveys concerning the mortality and morbidity of infants and children in
the communities with which we deal and the impact on these statistics of both the presence
of safe drinking water and of the APLV hygiene program. We are currently working on
writing up the results of this study, but one of the incidental findings was that an
appreciable fraction of the campesino children of these communities suffer from
malnutrition. These deprived children generally belong to families who own either very
little or no land. We are investigating the potential of organizing supplementary meals
for the youngest children who need them most. </p>

<p>Health and Nutrition Program Update</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="2">

<p>by Lilliam Obando and Gregoria Espinoza</p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="3">Our work with the rural communities has been a beautiful
experience since we are sharing knowledge and learning side-by-side with the members of
the communities in which we work. The relationships we have developed within the
communities are ones of closeness and trust.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of our main priorities has been our educational work with children.
By helping children form and develop better habits, the health of the communities will
improve in the future. We are currently working with 3500 school age children and some 240
nursery school children in 5 food kitchen programs. Another priority group that we have is
the women since they are the main caregivers to the children and do the majority of the
household chores. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the past three years we feel we have achieved some positive
results in terms of health and hygiene in the communities: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Decrease in cases of diarrhea</li>
  <li>Since the beginning of 1998, there has not been a single case of cholera in any of the
    communities in which we are working.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Improvements in family and community hygiene and cleanliness. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>With our support the UN World Food Program has initiated food kitchens in five
    communities for children under the age of five. </li>
  <li>We have created and improved educational materials and pamphlets that we are using in
    the communities and in schools.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our work in health promotion is both rewarding and difficult. We are
hoping to change values and habits, and that can only be achieved over the long term.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reflections on La Ponzoña</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By Josh Briemberg</p>
</font></i><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been a long, arduous road but the La Ponzoña water and latrine
project has been completed and inauguration is scheduled for Friday, July 2nd, 1999. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since becoming part of the Agua Para La Vida team in Nicaragua three
years ago, I have been part of nine project inaugurations. It is always rewarding to share
the pride and celebration of such monumental accomplishments with the community. But in
this sense, the La Ponzoña project inauguration is the longest coming and on a personal
level it will be easily one of the most rewarding.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The project itself is relatively small in scale, serving 25 severely
marginalized families living along the road at the entrance to Rio Blanco. The material
cost of the project was correspondingly small, just under $8,000, yet completing this
project took three full years of persistence by a core group within the community and the
unfailing support of Agua Para La Vida. At some point along the way I made a definite
decision that I was not going to leave Rio Blanco before doing all I could to make this
project possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my first assignments when I arrived in Rio Blanco was to attend
a meeting where the community of La Ponzoña presented their request for the study and
design of a potable water project to alleviate one of the principal obstacles of this
community. I set out with a group from the community led by Enma Reyes and Feliciana
Zeledon. Over the next few weeks we climbed up and down searching for springs in the steep
slopes that surround La Ponzoña.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than seven potential spring supplies were identified, and flow
studies and surveying were conducted. The flow rate of the very first spring identified
was measured by engineering technician in training Juan Romero using his rubber boot
because he had forgotten to take a plastic bucket on the trip. A major obstacle faced by
this community, as in many of the communities we work with, was the legal and/or financial
means to obtain rights to the spring water from the land owners where the springs were
located.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One spring owner after the next rejected the appeals of the provisional
community water committee. The committee sought the support of the municipality, church
leaders, the European Community-sponsored development group in Rio Blanco, all to no
avail. At the forefront of the community in the pre-project stage and until completion
were Enma Reyes and Feliciana Zeledon. These two women persisted in the search for a
solution to the obstacles faced by the project. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the failure to obtain legal rights to any of the
proposed springs, funding from Water For People that had been approved in 1997 for the
proposed project by had to be redirected by APLV to an alternate project in the community
of Wanawas. This was a serious setback to the project. But the community persisted and two
adequate springs were located in early 1998 where the owners were willing to cede water
rights (one with legal documents and the other only verbally) to the community. The
completely revised project proposal was ultimately approved for funding at the end of 1998
and construction began.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the topographic conditions of the community - it is located on a
steep mile-long slope - APLV had to design two separate water systems. The upper system
could only support public tapstands due to a shortage of water supply from the spring. The
lower system was designed to compensate for this shortage by providing a public wash
station for use by the people from the upper section. This physical separation of the two
water systems should have been another obstacle to the community in project execution but
the strength and continuing determination of Enma Reyes and Doña Feliciana made a unified
community effort possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the end, the La Ponzoña project represents the persistence and
struggle of a group of marginalized families and the success of Agua Para La Vida&#146;s
continual local presence and flexible approach to finding and supporting appropriate and
adequate solutions in response to a community&#146;s demonstrated interest and
participation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his role as Program Manager for<i> Water for People</i> (WFP)<i>, </i>John
Niewoehner was very supportive of APLV&#146;s work. He worked hard to coordinate
sponsorship from local WFP chapters for several APLV water projects as well as
scholarships for APLV students. He visited Rio Blanco in 1998 to see our work firsthand
and has been a great help in spreading the APLV story. He left his post with WFP in April
to work on a water and sanitation project in Lhasa, Tibet.</p>
